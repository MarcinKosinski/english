# Recommending Patrik -- a speaker of Why R? 2018

Some time ago I organized an R confernce, which gathered people from various countries in Wroclaw, where for 4 days we were exchanging our knowledge and experiences. This is always a good opportunity for everyone to extend their network and job possibilities. 

> After the conference Patrik, my friend from Liberec (Czech Republic) was motivated enought to take a stab and start a special online course from text mining as a creator. He was asked to list few recommendations about his English skills, and that's why I came up with this recommendation in a form of an e-mail. There you go!

My name is Marcin Kosinski. I organized Why R? 2018 conference. During last week I spoke on around 10 conferences and attended 20 community events in total, that's why I think I have a proper sense to verify whether someone is a fluent speaker or not (full list of my talks is available [here](http://r-addict.com/About.html)). Since 3 years I'm involved in the organization of conferences called Why R? and PL in ML [https://plinml.mimuw.edu.pl/](https://plinml.mimuw.edu.pl/) (this year 529 attendees). On a daily basis I'm involved in the scoring process of potentional speakers before they get a green light to present at the final event. I'm involved in decision process where we pick and invite keynotes from all over the world to speak at our events.

Why R? 2018 conference was an international meeting that gathered 300 participants in Wroclaw, Poland this year (whyr.pl/2018/). We, as organizers, estimate that during two simultaneous sessions there could be around 150-200 people in one room at the same time.

Patrik Drhlik gave a lightning talk during Lighting Talks sessions which was the only session during that time since due to its popularity we decided to cancel the second session happening in the same time in other room. As far as I remember there could be around 200 people as well in the room. That’s the photo of a full room, the moment a [keynote speech is held](https://www.facebook.com/whyRconf/photos/a.685921651758747/685925791758333/?type=3&theater)

Patrik’s talk seems very intriguing since the early beginning for the scientific committee that were scoring abstracts to be accepted or declined for the conference talks. We gave Patrik a green light to impress us with his fascinating study about the text mining and we were not disappointed. What is more, we were delighted to have Patrik speaking at our event. Not only the topic was interesting but also the way and the form in which Patrik spoke was very pleasant to observe. Never have I seen such a fluent speaking debut (I’ve heard from Patrik it was his first public speech on the international conference). There was a passion for the topic, cheerfulness in the attitude and a brilliantly prepared logic of the presentation. Even though the talk was short, it looked like a lot of effort and energy was put into preparations, from which one can conclude Patrik is a hard-working person that always tries his best the moment he commits to something. It was a delightful pleasure to hear Patrik and I hope to see him next year on the upcoming 3rd edition of the conference. Rarely has the community such a motivational speaker that easily shuffles anecdotes and jokes during a passionate and thrilling talk. I forecast a successful speaking career opening in front of Patrik.

We even caught him speaking on a photography available on [our fan-page](

Additionally, I can personally say Patrik is an easy-to work collaborator and a volcano of an energy and optimism in a daily life.
