# Motivation

One day I caught myself trying to explain whether I work in a remote or in a global company, when it finally clicked for me that
the company's setup is actually best described by the `distributed` term. It happened on a recent hiring call we had at [Gradient Metircs](http://gradientmetrics.com/)
during winter interviews in 2018. As always we try to introduce company's structure as smooth as possible, and the best trigger is often the recrutiment process.
We are settled in 4 countries, posses citizenship of 3 of them and together speak more than 7 languauges, hence there are still only 4 of us.

I was given an outstanding opportunity to verify my statistical knowledge during projects in a multi-language market research company, which is an unpredictabely challening, since the complex mathematical solutions or advanced computer science techniques are being explained and synthetized in the foreign language, which English is for me.

After 2 years of a day to day cooperation in a foreign language, more than 10 talks on international conferences and dozens of schmoozing English occasions, I've realized my last English classes I had were actually held in 2010, which is 8 years from now! No matter how many converstaions you have, nor the amount of movies you see or stories you read, there is still a wide area of activities one can perform to push his/hers English skills to its limits. 

Mastering foreign language is even harder in your home country, because you are not exposed to talking and hearing situations very often.
