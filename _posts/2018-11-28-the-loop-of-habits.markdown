# Targeting Clients Improved By Brain Studies About Habits

Recently I had a pleasure to dive into [a chapter from Charles Duhigg book `A Power of Habit`|https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?_r=1&fbclid=IwAR2g0UM8nlfRv4kE2y8VgZN_ABT2pUYZH27e-pOwgiG_FDbirskjPws81Bo] on a silent Monday evening, with a tea in on hand and, yeah, smart-phone on another. The topic immediately came fascinating to me as explains human behavior and strategies companies have to influence human habits.

A wide variety of research has been held to gain insights into the workflow of human mental behavior in cycles we take during repeated activities, called habits. Primary goals of different research leaders are diverse, since they represent extreme motivations: from a scientific research that can help humanity grow, to the companies' studies that are targeted to possess new clients, hence maximize the company's revenue. The essential message is the fact both sides have discovered same routines that rules human brains and in complince with which humanity is aware on how and when change people's habits.

Even though many past habits have extinguished, we still, as a population of singularities, develop new habit behaviors, where one can list: backing a car, making a coffee in a coffee machine, cleaning the house, morning hygiene. One can anticipate that almost every activity that starts is repeatable, sooner or later, will become our habit. Furthermore, the action will be taken with less conscious and awareness, whereas with more automation. Ingenious could be a person that is aware of the mechanism that drives habits we've used to to provide useful knowledge for his company on how to extend profits from their market share. Researchers are gathering vast amount of data to get message across influential moments in our lives that allows us to change our habit patterns, where the bottom line is changing our market habits to pick another brands - their brands.  

Yielding broad survey results helped decipher situations in which customers are more likely and more exposed to change their marketing habits, which are: birth of a child, a marriage, moving to other city changing a job or a house we live in. Such milestones, when one overhauls his daily life, affects our habits and let us write them on our own from the beginning, since the scenario in which we are facing life challenges, has also changed dramatically. 

My personal thoughts let me conceive situations in which I will be most exposed to habit changes, nonetheless the article also listed ways on how to influence current habits without drastic life game changers. It's possible without outstanding performances. As soon as one understands that the habit is a cycle, triggered by a spark, called cue and ended by a gratification called reward, the moment we are able to change actual behavior during the habit routine or we are capable to start new useful habits the moment we know how to provide a cue and remarkable prize (reward). In spite of many time I've tried starting running, now I see I wasn't eager enough to take care of a small prize after each running session, which disabled my brain to transform running into a habit. It boils down to few simple advises:
- If you want to start performing a successful, new habit you need a spark.
- Each habit is written into our subconscious mind the moment it ends with a boost of happiness, which can be caused by a small prize.
- Habit can be substituted to be more human friendly and less unhealthy, if we stick to the same spark but we diagnose the proper prize in the workflow.

To summarize, being equipped with that new knowledge, I'm thrilled and excited on how I can rule my future and current habits by being aware of its mechanism.
